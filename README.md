# Brain Tumor Classification: Project Overview
Classifying Brain tumor images using Keras and Open CV.
* Created a data pipeline to load images, after converting them into RGB, into a numpy array
* Built the model using Keras API consisting of 3 Conv2D layers
* Built the Flash API for backend

## Packages & Run
* python 3.9.6
* tensorflow 2.5.1
* Flask 2.0.1

To run the app, write ```python app.py``` in the terminal
